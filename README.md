# Hexagonal Kata

This is my implementation of [Matteo Vaccari's Hexagonal Kata](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154),
otherwise known as the birthday greetings kata.

## Requirements

* Java 7
* IntelliJ to load the project .iml and test run configuration

I built and tested this project in IntelliJ 12, use the included .iml and the "All Tests" run configuration to run.
I haven't yet created a build script since I did everything in IntelliJ for now.
